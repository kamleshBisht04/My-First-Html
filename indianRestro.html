    <img src="./image/ChickenFraDiavolo_Chicken-Fra-Diavolo_Bibi_.png" alt="ChickenFraDiavolo_Chicken-Fra-Diavolo_Bibi_images" width="300" height="300" />
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><span>
        <li>6 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs, salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, 1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 hot red pepper, chopped, 4 cloves garlic, minced, 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste, 1/2 cup white wine, such as Pinot Grigio</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste, 1 (14 1/2 ounce) crushed fire roasted tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh basil, plus more for garnish, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li></span>
    </ul>
    <ol><span>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels, and trim away extra skin and excess fat. Season each chicken thigh with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>In a large, oven-safe skillet, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat.</li>
        <li>When the butter is bubbling, add chicken thighs. Being careful not to crowd the skillet, work in batches to brown each thigh, 3 to 5 minutes per side. When all the thighs are browned, remove to a plate and keep warm.</li>
        <li>To the same skillet, add chopped onions and hot red pepper. Cook until the onions begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, Italian seasoning, and crushed red pepper flakes and cook until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Stir in wine, add tomato paste, and cook about 3 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes and minced basil and cook until sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Nestle browned chicken thighs, skin side up, into the sauce, and add any accumulated juices.</li>
        <li>Place skillet in oven; bake until an instant-read thermometer reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) when inserted near the center of chicken thighs.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with minced fresh parsley and garnish with additional basil leaves, if desired. Top with shredded Parmesan cheese, to taste. Serve warm.</li></span>
